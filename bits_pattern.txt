BIT CONTRIBUTION PATTERN
------------------------

For any bitwise aggregation (XOR, OR, AND),
treat each bit b independently.

Compute:
    count1[b] = number of elements with bit b == 1
    count0[b] = n - count1[b]

Then find:
    how many subsets/pairs/sequences make bit b contribute?

Typical formulas:

XOR(subsets): contributes 2^(n-1) times if count1[b] > 0
OR(subsets): contributes (2^n - 2^count0[b]) times
AND(subsets): contributes (2^count1[b] - 1) times

XOR(pairs): contributes count1[b] * count0[b]
OR(pairs): contributes nC2 - count0[b]C2

General:
    sum += (1 << b) * contribution
